The latest version of this pdf can be downloaded [here](`r knitr::asis_output(link_pdf)`).

<br>

This project has two primary goals. The first is to conduct fish passage (Phase 1) and habitat confirmation (Phase 2) assessments within the Nation River watershed group. The second goal is to implement baseline monitoring at previously assessed and/or remediated crossings in the Parsnip, Crooked, and Carp River watershed groups. Fieldwork will include electrofishing at permitted sites and collection of environmental DNA (eDNA) samples. 

<br>

Field activities will be completed with support from crews from McLeod Lake Indian Band and other partner organizations. A summary of potential sites for fish passage assessments, habitat confirmation assessments, and electrofishing is provided in Table \@ref(tab:tab-electrofishing-sites) and Figure \@ref(fig:map-prep). Google Earth (KML) and Garmin (GPX) files for the proposed sites are available for download [here](`r knitr::asis_output(link_kml)`). Georeferenced pdf maps for select watershed groups can be accessed and downloaded [here](`r knitr::asis_output(link_fieldmaps)`).

## Emergency Response Plan {.unnumbered}

New Graph Environment's detailed emergency response procedures can be found [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/hsp/plans-and-assessments.html#emergency-response-plan-erp-and-procedures). These procedures should be reviewed and an emergency response plan should be completed for each job site. Our Emergency Responce Plan template can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/hsp/blob/master/data/form_templates/ERP_template.pdf).

<br>

## Driving {.unnumbered}

We will be driving on forest service roads where it is essential to exercise caution and adhere strictly to all radio use protocols to ensure our safety. Proper communication on these roads helps prevent accidents by keeping everyone informed about vehicle movements and road conditions. Please review the [resource road safety](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/hsp/safe-work-procedures-and-practices.html#resource-road-safety) and [radio use](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/hsp/safe-work-procedures-and-practices.html#radio-use) sections of our Health and Safety plan so that everyone stays safe. 

<br>

## Field Plan {.unnumbered}

Fieldwork will focus on baseline monitoring in the Parsnip, Crooked, and Carp River watershed groups, and fish passage (Phase 1) and habitat confirmation (Phase 2) assessments in the Nation River watershed group. Activities will include electrofishing at permitted sites and the collection of environmental DNA (eDNA) samples. Crews from McLeod Lake Indian Band and other partners will support the fieldwork. 

<br>

Fieldwork methods will result in products feeding reporting formats such as our [2024](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_peace_2024_reporting/) and [2023](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_peace_2023_reporting/) reports. We generally follow procedures in:

-   [fish passage assessments](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/land-based-investment/forests-for-tomorrow/field-assessment-for-determining-fish-passage-status-of-cbs.pdf) [@ministryofenvironment2011Fieldassessment]

-   [habitat confirmations](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/land-based-investment/forests-for-tomorrow/checklist-for-fish-habitat-confirmation-201112.pdf) [@confirmation_checklist_2011].

<br>

Information on fish presence/absence, species composition, density, and distribution limits is useful for prioritizing crossings for fish passage restoration and informing follow-up monitoring. To support this, electrofishing, minnow trapping, and eDNA sampling may be conducted where appropriate. Standard Fish and Fish Habitat Inventory Field Forms ([site cards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/laws-policies-standards-guidance/inventory-standards/aquatic-ecosystems)) are used to collect habitat data. The field guide for completing these forms is available [here](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/nr-laws-policy/risc/sitecard20.pdf).

<br>

Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tagging equipment is available and may be used to mark fish captured at electrofishing sites. Tagging can support long-term monitoring by providing data on population size and fish movement upstream and downstream of crossings. An overview of the tagging process is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CKZ9yaS5o8). To anesthetize fish prior to PIT tagging, we use a clove oil solution at 0.1mL/L (1:10,000), which provides effective sedation with minimal residual effects [@fernandes_etal2017efficacyclove]. The solution is prepared by dissolving clove oil in ethyl alcohol at a 1:9 ratio before mixing into water [@fernandes_etal2017efficacyclove].

<br>

Digital field forms are used to collected data, utilizing [Mergin Maps](https://merginmaps.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxb2XBhDBARIsAOjDZ34oq-iMid3vRrgK1ZAkJ_yiz4aWY-LLF90PHiXzELbZIrxooV9vWKYaAgl2EALw_wcB), which syncs with QGIS and supports offline use. Instructions for setting up Mergin Maps and using the digital field forms can be found in the [Fish Passage Guidebook](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_guidebook/). Users should send their Mergin usernames to enable project sharing and form access.

<br>

A field guide to freshwater fish identification, such as *Field Key to the Freshwater Fishes of British Columbia* by @mcphail_carveth1993FieldKey, can be useful during fieldwork. It is available for download [here](https://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/documents/r13659/486FieldKeytoFreshwaterFishes1993Part1of2_1210014849226_8e248a8d30d97e6c45ef54a340babd2ffb57b14a3b16.pdf).

<br>

### Check In Procedures {-}

Call, text, or InReach Tara Stark (2505059854) each morning to share the plan for the day (i.e. name of roads and sites). Check in time is before 7pm each evening although we regularly check in throughout the day (ex. at arrival to site, 1pm and 4pm) on the InReach or by text and report position/provide updates.

<br>

#### Procedures for Failed Check-In - for Check in person {-}

Procedures are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:flow-check-in-fail). If phone call or InReach check-in is not received by 7pm send text to InReach units, call or text cell phones of field crew members. If no response please call accommodations then personal emergency contacts to see if they have heard anything. Wait 1 hour and text InReach, text or call cell phones and personal emergency contacts and accommodations again. Repeat after 2 hours (9 pm) - if no response then notify the RCMP of a missing persons in field.
